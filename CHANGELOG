0.1		-  First release of firefox plugin.

0.2		-  Fixed problems with install - upgraded versions that were 'allowed'.

0.2.1		-	Changed some peculiarities, hoping it will speed some things up for some users.
			-	Added support for 'src' tags (this was necessary for img elements especially).

0.3		-	Fixed issues with install.rdf (patch contributed by Matthew Walker <matthaeus123@gmail.com>)
			-	Much faster response (not loading JVM this time) - for some reason was doing this with DNS lookups

0.3.1		-	Updated install.rdf (another Matthew Walker production)
